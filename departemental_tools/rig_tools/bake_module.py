# General info header.
# source= dynamic layer, target= Animation bake layer. animation bake layer is child of dynamic layer.
# While baking double transform will occur.
# ctrl= the animators ctrl, the one they will animate
#General idea. From the selected controller you go fetch the nucleus. And from the nucleus you go fetch the controller's
#parents. This will give you all the concerned spring controller to bake in one go.
